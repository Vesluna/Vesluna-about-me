        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>The stars are like distant universes, floating through endless space—just like ours. They're watching, predicting, and weaving countless alternate futures, some of which could go awry or turn out great. But hey, enough about that. Hey, HAii, what's up? I’m Vesluna (yeah, that's my real name, well, it'll be my real name), and it means Evening Star Moon. Why am I telling you this? Well, you’re here to get to know me, right?</p>
        <p>So, here's the deal: I don’t really have a ton of hobbies or anything super exciting, but there are a few things I dive into. For one, I’m learning coding! I’m tackling CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Unfortunately, I didn’t make this profile myself (not quite there yet), but I’m working on it. Oh, and I’m super good at Scratch on <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">scratch.mit.edu</a>, although PEN has been a bit tricky for me lately.</p>
        <p>Also, I make music on SoundCloud! :D If you wanna check it out or support me, the links should be around here, and I even have a Discord server (it’s not super popular, but I really hope it gets buzzing one day).</p>
        <p>I guess that’s about it for now. So, yeah, have a good day, night, or whatever time it is for you!</p>
